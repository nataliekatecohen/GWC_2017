      <p>I am currently 17 years old and a rising senior attending James Madison High School in Brooklyn. I joined Girls Who Code because I greatly enjoyed the two coding classes I took in school, and wanted to learn more about the subject. The world is moving in the direction of technology, and I wish to be a part of it. I love to read, play video games, hang out with friends, and snack on sweets in my free time, when I’m not stressing out over school.

    <p>I am currently a 15 year old rising junior attending the High School of American Studies at Lehman College in the Bronx. I joined Girls Who Code because of how much my brother enjoyed it. Ever since I was a young girl I liked to work with computers and since my computer always got viruses I would always try to remove them. I chose to do this project because I myself struggled with being body-confident and think it’s important to learn to appreciate your body.

      <p>I am currently 17 years old and a rising senior attending Mount Olive High School in New Jersey. I joined Girls Who Code because I have always been interested in computer science, but never had the mentors or guidance to actually pursue it. I chose to do this project because since I was a little girl I have struggled with my body and loving myself and I believe everyone is special and unique in their own way and should embrace that.
